This is an application made in Clojure as an idea to create something that could help runners both novice and intermediate level in decisions on whether they should run and where, in turn exploring new paths and make running more enjoyable
How to run

Clone the project on your device and run the main file, this will start a server at localhost with port 8080.

You can interact via postman with this server but more user friendly UI exists here

When you also clone this project and run it with command npm run dev accessing it is simple at port 3000.

If you want more details on how this app came to be and how to interact with it, you can do so in this [wiki](https://github.com/PredragStisovic/ClojureProject/wiki/2.-Idea).
